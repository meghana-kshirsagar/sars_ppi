<h2> Plots </h2>
PCA/T-SNE interactive plot is in the <b>allviruses_plot.html</b> html file and should be downloaded and opened in a browser to visualize. Also available are GO enrichment visualizations.

<h2> Predictions </h2>
Predictions from the model on all pairs of virus-human proteins are in the results directory

<h2> GO Enrichment analysis </h2>
Detailed GO enrichment analysis results and plots are in the enrichment_analysis directory
